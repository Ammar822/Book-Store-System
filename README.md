# Quantum Book Store 

A simple object-oriented Python project that models an online bookstore with different types of books (Paper, EBook, Showcase). It supports adding books, removing outdated ones, and handling purchases with appropriate services for shipping and emailing.

---

## Features

*  **PaperBook**: Has stock, can be shipped to a physical address.
*  **EBook**: Has a filetype, can be sent via email.
*  **ShowcaseBook**: Not for sale, just a display item.
*  Add books with details: ISBN, title, author, year, price, quantity.
*  Remove outdated books (based on a maximum age in years).
*  Purchase a book (quantity, email, address required).
*  Simulated mail and shipping services.
*  Modular and easily extensible (can add more book types with minimal changes).

---

## Project Structure

* `Book (abstract)`: base class for all books.
* `PaperBook`, `EBook`, `ShowcaseBook`: subclasses implementing behavior.
* `Inventory`: manages book storage and operations.
* `MailService`, `ShippingService`: dummy service classes.
* `QuantumBookstoreFullTest`: test runner with sample data and actions.

1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
2. Save the code to a `.py` file (e.g., `quantum_bookstore.py`).
3. Run it:
